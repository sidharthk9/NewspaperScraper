# NewspaperScraper


Three spiders were configured to harvest the content of a local newspaper for satire purposes.

The spiders harvest the content of the articles, editorials, and their respective titles through the framework's CSS selectors.

Then, the scraped content is funnelled into a MongoDB Atlas cluster for further use.


The three spiders need the Scrapy toolset, like the CLI amongst others, in order to function.
